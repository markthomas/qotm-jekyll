title: Introduction to Python vs. Ruby
category: pyvrb

Many years ago I worked for an organization that was largely a Java shop but my particular group had burgeoning pythonistas and rubyists. One interesting thing was that there was no overlap--the pythonistas didn't know Ruby and the Rubyists didn't know Python. I was squarely in the Ruby camp at the time. One of my co-workers had an internal blog espousing the virtues of python by way of showing little snippets of code with exclamations like, "isn't this the simplest, easiest-to-read code you've ever seen?"

This was, of course, a gauntlet thrown. I set up a blog which would mirror his, post for post, showing the python snippet and the equivalent in Ruby. Often the Ruby code would be both more concise and read more like English. This turned into a friendly competition and my colleague started specifially choosing snippets in which Python really shone. So we started asking our Java friends to pick a winner. I would post that on the blog.

The end result was that I learned a lot of Python idioms, and likewise my colleague developed an appreciation for Ruby. I got feedback from developers just learning Ruby or Python that my blog was informative and fun to follow. 

So this blog category aims to resurrect that friendly competitive spirit. Hopefully it will be interesting if not informative, especially if you're learning one of these fine languages.
